/**
 * Tables generated straight from the real collection configs, not
 * hand-copied - see ./generate.ts. Each addition here is the next-smallest
 * step up in field-type coverage over the last:
 *
 *  - Faqs: scalar fields only (phase 1/2).
 *  - EventRSVPs: adds a single-target relationship field, still one row per
 *    document (an `event_id` FK column, not a child table).
 *  - MembershipTiers: adds row-wrapped fields (flattened onto this table,
 *    same as Payload's own schema does) and an array field (`benefits`,
 *    which needs its own child table - see membershipTiersBenefits below).
 *  - PageTemplates: adds a `blocks` field (one child table per block type -
 *    see pageTemplatesBlocks below) and, inside two of those block types
 *    (Faq's `faqs`, Gallery's `images`), hasMany relationship/upload fields -
 *    these write into the collection's single shared `_rels` table
 *    (pageTemplatesRels) rather than becoming columns of their own. See
 *    ./generate.ts's generateBlockTables/generateRelsTable doc comments for
 *    the real D1 shapes this mirrors, confirmed by creating a real document
 *    through Payload's own engine and inspecting the resulling tables.
